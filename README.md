## Welcome to Ojo de Agua Management project

Our application will be split into:

- frontend
- backend

### Frontend
- [react](https://react.dev/)

If you want to run frontend application go to frontend directory, install dependencies and run with `npm run dev`

Steps:

- `cd frontend`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`



### Backend

- Backend(API REST) is going to be built into [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/)
- Database service is built locally, we're going to use a cloud service (not defined yet) (supabase I think)
